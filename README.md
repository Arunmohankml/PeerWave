**PeerWave** is a lightweight, plug-and-play voice communication API for web apps, built using [PeerJS](https://peerjs.com/). This library allows you to integrate real-time voice chat between users with just a few function calls. This can be mainly used for proximity making proximity/normal voicechat in games with inbuilt browser or normal Websites.

- currently it's using peerjs default cloud server for signaling, it may cause minor bugs, feel free to contribute and upgrade these features.
